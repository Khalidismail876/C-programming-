### Evaluation of Bash and Arduino
Arduino is more simpler than bash. When it comes to coding, arduino seems to be easier and more understandable,
while bash is a little bit complicated. One thing that makes Arduino more easeir is that the coding syntax is more relatable
to other coding program like C++. But Bash has an advantage over Arduino, which is that you can use it anytime you want 
since its linked in your terminal. if you compare the varibales in Bash and Arduino, it feels like that Arduino's varaibles is
a little bit complicated than Bash. Overall, Arduino is a better coding system for me at least. 



### Reflection 1

We started learning about arduino programmaning first,
and we practiced how to do a basic coding for arduino.
after we practiced a little bit, we started using arduino for binary code.
We have been learning and making codes for the binary numbers,
We made a program that converts decimal to binary.
We have also learned a binary reading, where 
we convert the binary to expression which then helped us create 
a code for it.

I feel like the classes have been fun since we had to use actual tools 
that led us create something like a traffic light. Also not using the computer all the time 
inside the class was a great help and I had the chance to do binary convertion with my own hands. 

Question: When are we going to start dividing teams to develope the communication system for the planets?

### Reflection 2

We were talking about how to use the two button that is provided for our Marcial decode 
we discussed how we need to use this two button so that we can let the users have easier time communicating with 
other people
We have also learn Usibility and discoveribility feedback
these are the way which the designers need to think when they are making their software

Question :  When is the project for unit 2 due?
