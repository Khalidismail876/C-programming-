### Evaluation of Bash and Arduino
Arduino is more simpler than bash. When it comes to coding, arduino seems to be easier and more understandable,
while bash is a little bit complicated. One thing that makes Arduino more easeir is that the coding syntax is more relatable
to other coding program like C++. But Bash has an advantage over Arduino, which is that you can use it anytime you want 
since its linked in your terminal. if you compare the varibales in Bash and Arduino, it feels like that Arduino's varaibles is
a little bit complicated than Bash. Overall, Arduino is a better coding system for me at least.
