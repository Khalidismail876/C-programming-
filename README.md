### Definition of the Problem

The year is 2050 and many people want to explore different planets, but one problem that they are facing is they can't communicate with other planets. This is happening due to lack of developing advance communicating tools. We are assigned to make a communicating tool that connect Earth, Moon, and Mars. Since its hard to transfer all the data from Earth to Mars, we made moon be the mediator of Earth and Mars. The people in Mars wanted all their communicaton system as Binary Code and for people in the moon to transfer the informaion from Earth to Binary Code they require the communication system from eath be Morse Code. The reverse has to happen to, Mars people will send binary Code to moon and moon peoeple will convert binary code to Morse code.
